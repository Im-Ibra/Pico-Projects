# Pico-Projects
## Just a repo to keep track of my Raspberry Pi Pico experiments and learning journey.
## It’s not meant to be polished — more like a digital notebook where I try and break things.

### Each project has the micropython code file and a fritzing file where you can see the build setup used for the project
